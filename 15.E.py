"""
Write a program that reads an indefinite number of values, corresponding to grades, ending the data entry when a value
equal to -1 is informed (which should not be stored). After this data entry, do:
a) Show the amount of values that were read;
b) Display all values in the order they were entered, one next to the other;
c) Display all values in reverse order, one below the other;
d) Calculate and display the sum of the values;
e) Calculate and display the average of the values;
f) Calculate and display the amount of values above the calculated average;
g) Calculate and display the number of values below seven;
h) End the program with a message;
